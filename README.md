I have realized that it is not going to be very beneficial for me with spending time over canvas and images. So I have abandoned this repo for now. But I will pick this up at a later point of time for hobby purposes.

# timer-clock
A stop watch, full screen analog and digital clock 

**TODO**
- A fullscreen analog clock
- A digital display
- add a flavour of themes
- add a stop watch for countdowns
- lets add a reverse clock too, that turns in anti clockwise
- a sand-dial animation will look yay!!
